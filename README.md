__Note:__ Please note that this is a simplified implementation and lacks some advanced features like handling refunds if the funding goal is not reached or managing contributors' balances. In a real-world application, you would likely need to consider additional functionality and security measures. Always conduct thorough testing and ensure security before deploying smart contracts in a production environment.
